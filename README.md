Open source research based on effective altruism principles for impact investing

Effective altruism hypothesis: impact is proportional to three factors. Those factors are scale, neglectedness, and solvability.
1. Scale
- Good done per percent of problem solved
- It's fairly easy to get a sense of scale by looking at the absolute savings in energy or emissions for a solution
2. Neglectedness
- Percent of problem solved per percent increase in resources
- Total investment (public and private) into a solution or amount of people working on solutions to said issue
3. Solvability
- Percent increase in resources per $ or extra person
- "The doubling of effort would solve X % of the problem"

Using a logarithmic scale allows us to compare each solution more easily and also means that rather than having to multiply Scale, Solvability and Neglectedness in order to get our overall cost-effectiveness estimate, we can simply add them together.
